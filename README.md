## ITS Private Cloud ``cloud-init`` implementation

The ITS Private Cloud implementation of ``cloud-init`` is using the ``NoCloud`` datastore
to ensure wider compatibility accross multiple operating systems.

To deploy a VM and generate an iso seed, the ``vss-cli`` provides two methods:
- ``compute vm mk from-clib``: traditional options using ``--network-config`` and ``--user-data``. i.e [deploy_cli.sh](deploy_cli.sh)
- ``compute vm mk from-file``: ``vss-cli`` specification to deploy vms declaratively. i.e [deploy_spec.sh](deploy_spec.sh) and [spec](spec/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-spec.yaml)

## Virtual Machine specs

The virtual machine to deploy in both [deploy_spec.sh](deploy_spec.sh) and [deploy_cli.sh](deploy_cli.sh) has the following specs:
- 1x100 GiB Disk for the OS on `hdd`.
- 4GiB of Memory
- 2 vCPUs
- Secure Boot and UEFI.

All the above is defined in [spec](spec/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-spec.yaml).

## Cloud-Init

The `cloud-init` folder stores two main files: ``network.yaml`` and ``userdata.yaml``. The ``userdata.yaml`` holds the main configuration that will be applied to the openSUSE OS upon deployment.

This example makes the following customizations to the OS:
- Install packages defined in ``packages`` section.


The following sections are recommended to update:
- ``hostname`` and ``fqdn`` 
-``users`` section with the list of users to allow access to the server, including `ssh-keys` and hashed passwords. The ``vss-cli misc hash-string`` command is recommended to generate hashed passwords.

## Requirements

- ITS Private Cloud cli aka vss-cli >= v2022.10.1.
- Target vCenter Folder.
- Target vCenter Network.

## Deployment

### ITS Private Cloud CLI ``vss-cli`` spec

1. Edit [spec](spec/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-spec.yaml) and update any settings that may apply to your Org unit, such as `folder`, `name`, `network` or any other item in the metadata section. Note that if you change the network to one that does not have DHCP enabled, ``cloud_init.network_data`` must be added
2. Edit [user-data](cloud-init/userdata.yaml) and update recommended settings mentioned in the [#Cloud-Init](#cloud-init) section.
3. (Optional) Edit [network-config](cloud-init/network.yaml) and update your networking settings based on the network selected in step 1 ([spec](spec/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-spec.yaml))
4. Run the following command or execute ``sh deploy_spec.sh``:
    ```
    vss-cli --wait compute vm mk from-file spec/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-spec.yaml
    ```
    **output:**
    ```
    id                  : 10416

### ITS Private Cloud CLI ``vss-cli``

1. Edit [user-data](cloud-init/userdata.yaml) and update recommended settings mentioned in the [#Cloud-Init](#cloud-init) section.
2. (Optional) Edit [network-config](cloud-init/network.yaml) and update your networking settings based on the network selected in step 1 ([spec](spec/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-spec.yaml))
3. Edit the following command or script  ``sh deploy_cli.sh`` and update any settings that may apply to your department or unit, such as `--folder`, `name`, `--net`. Note that if you change the network to one that does not have DHCP enabled, ``--network-config`` must be added:
    ```
    vss-cli --wait compute vm mk from-clib \
    --memory 4 --cpu 2 \
    --source openSUSE \
    --disk 100 --firmware efi \
    --description 'openSUSE Tumbleweed server' \
    --client EIS --os opensuse64Guest --usage Prod \

## Use

Once the VM is deployed, you could access it via ``ssh`` on port ``22`` and see the ``cloud-init`` log to verify everything is working fine.

### SSH

1. Open your terminal or PuTTY client and point to the IP address provided in the email, if either the ``VSS-CGN`` or ``VSS-PUBLIC`` network was selected. Otherwise, use the IP address predefined in [network.yaml](cloud-init/network.yaml).
2. Use any of the defined users in the [userdata.yaml](cloud-init/userdata.yaml) file. 
3. Open a new session using port ``22``:
    ```
    ssh vss-admin@100.76.XX.XXX                                              
    The authenticity of host '100.76.XX.XXX (100.76.XX.XXX)' can't be established.
    ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:WgvWDq2aTO8tyee4eX8nlAsrVC/K/DW8/LN9QyfQfy8.
    This key is not known by any other names.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '100.76.XX.XXX' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
    Have a lot of fun...
    vss-admin@opensuse-cloud-test:~> 

    ```
4. Promote yourself as super user: ``sudo su``.
5. Inspect ``/var/log/cloud-init-output.log``.
